# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a framework in artificial intelligence that enhances the output of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information from external data sources. This means RAG combines the strengths of both retrieval-based and generation-based AI models.
